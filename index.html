    <h2>My growth over Origami</h2> <!--br/ creates a line break-->
    <p> Origami has been something I've been doing 
        for 9 years, first my dad showed me how to 
        make a paper boat, then 2 years later I made
        a dragon. <br> <br>From there I expanded to learn lots
        more designs and now I can create a praying
        mantis  </p>

    <h2>Benifits of doing origami</h2>
<p>

  <ul>

<li> Calming
<li> Cheap (Because its just paper)
<li> Cool
  </ul>

Calming
  </h3>
  <p>Origami can be calming for many reasons 
    for me personally its the art of folding 
    nothing into something. Imagine being able to turn
    just a regular sheet of paper into a work of art.
    Thats pretty cool right? I know it is beacuse ive 
    been doing it for <strong>9 YEARS</strong>.

    <h3>Cost</h3>

      <p>Origmai is pretty cheap (well it's paper so it should)
        I don't think I've ever had to buy paper of my own. 
        my dad god <strong> BOXES</strong> of printer paper for his work
        but the one's he got were the wrong size. Because of the error in size
        of paper, he gave me all the boxes of paper he dident need.
        Its been 4 years and I still have 2 <Strong>BOXES</strong> of paper, as 
          well as 300 som sheets of Box 1.<br> <br>Paper is very cheap and if you
          can make something cool out of it to sell, then you can make some really good money.
